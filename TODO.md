## Bugs
- Fix weird styling issues when emulating on mobile device

- Fix glitchiness when scrolling during auto scroll (and make top of page visible until it doesn't need to be).
- ~~Make textscroll handle input as html rather than plaintext. (I wonder if just adding spaces will work if so?)~~
- ~~Add scrolling (no scrollbar) OR do what fallout does (UI showing there's more text below, use arrow to go down.) (will need to ensure textscroll is not absolute)~~
