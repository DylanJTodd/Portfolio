# Portfolio-OS: A Fallout 4-Inspired Terminal Portfolio

Portfolio-OS is an interactive portfolio website inspired by the retro-futuristic terminal interface of Fallout 4. Designed to showcase my projects, skills, and creative approach to design, it emphasizes accessibility, immersion, and customizability.

## Features

- **Fully Keyboard-Navigable** – The entire site can be used without a mouse, supporting users who prefer or require keyboard-based interaction.

- **Authentic Terminal Experience** – Includes scrolling text, caret animations, and sound effects for an immersive, old-school computer feel.

- **Customization Options** – Users can personalize terminal colors, text speed, and enable a low-graphics mode for performance optimization on low-spec machines.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte + TypeScript
- **Backend**: LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for smooth data communication
- **State Management**: Cookies to persist user preferences across sessions

## Controls

- **Enter** – Select menu options
- **Space** – Skip text animations
- **Arrow Keys** – Navigate through choices
- **Escape** – Go back or cancel an action
- **Tab / Shift+Tab** – Cycle through interactive elements

*While the site is optimized for keyboard navigation, all elements remain fully interactable using a mouse.*
